#Rocket Runners

This is Rocket Runners. Race your friends and show them who deserves that sweet world domination.  It has controller enabled multiplayer and is to be played on the big screen. Wipe out your friends off the screen to claim the points for yourself.
Hint: Hit a slope as you fall and you will go even faster forwards. Your downwards velocity is converted into forwards velocity. Basic physics!

Play with an xInput (xbox 360) controller with buttons a and x. Other gamepads may work but have not been tested.
The keyboard can be used as an alternative. Press buttons S and A for Dude, the evolved Lobster, and L and K for Olly, the Olympian.
Please note that the menu only works with keyboard or mouse at the moment

Contributions:
Procedurally Generated Terrain - a small amount of base code sourced, but built upon extensively for procedural random generation, generation distributed over multiple frames and a physics mesh collider
Music and sound composition - Synthesiser sound programming designed to suit the game.
Graphics - everything but characters and Facebook's like button created by me. Character spritesheets made with friend for game
Scripts - including dynamic volume sound, waypoint icons, smart point placement, animation control, movement, camera follower, customisable player, and more

Enjoy :)
