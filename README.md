# Rocket Runners

Note: this repository has not been update since I completed University.

### Game Overview
This is Rocket Runners. Race your friends and show them who deserves that sweet world domination.  It has controller enabled multiplayer and is to be played on the big screen. Wipe out your friends off the screen to claim the points for yourself.
Hint: Hit a slope as you fall and you will go even faster forwards. Your downwards velocity is converted into forwards velocity. Basic physics!

### Controls
Play with an xInput (xbox 360) controller with buttons a and x. Other gamepads may work but have not been tested.
The keyboard can be used as an alternative. Press buttons S and A for Dude, the evolved Lobster, and L and K for Olly, the Olympian.
Please note that the menu only works with keyboard or mouse at the moment

## Game Features:

### Procedurally Generated Terrain
Terrain is generated asynchronously over multiple frames and on demand if necessary. A physics mesh collider is created over the top.

### Music and sound composition
Synthesiser sound programming designed to suit the game.

### Graphics
Everything but characters and Facebook's like button created by me. Character spritesheets made with friend for game

### Scripts
Including dynamic volume sounds, waypoint icons, smart point placement, animation control, movement, camera follower, customisable player, and more

Have fun!
